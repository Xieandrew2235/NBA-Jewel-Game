# Unit-4-Assignment

For this assignment, I chose to create a NBA-themed shooting game, with quite possibly the worst shooters in NBA history (in their respective positions). At the start of each new game, the player is presented with a random Score to Win (between 19-120), which is reached by clicking on the images of any of the 4 players. Each image carries a random value between 1-12; if the player hits the exact number, it counts as a win, but if the total values exceed the Score to Win, a loss is counted and the game is reset.

## What I wish I could have added into my game

I wanted to add some animation into the beginning of the game that was basketball-related, and also a pop-up image at the end of the game before it reset, but when I tried doing both it ended up messing with my HTML and CSS in a bad way. I also tried centering the 4 images but after trying align-content, text-align, and margin-left/right, it did not work.
