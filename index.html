		<h3>Shaq, Lonzo, Ben Wallace, and Dennis Rodman are all great NBA players with unique individual talent, but they all
			share one common trait: they CAN'T shoot. Read the rules below to try and win the game with these dreadful shooters!</h3>
		</br>
		<ol>
			<li>You will be given a random number at the start of the game.<span>"Number To Get"</span></li>
			<li>There are four images of Shaq, Lonzo, Ben Wallace, and Dennis Rodman.</li>
			<li>Instead of scoring either 1,2, or 3 points as they would in a game, for each click on a certain player's
				image you will add a specific random amount of points (1 to 12 per click) to your total score.</li>
			<li>You win the game by matching your total score to the random number.</li>
			<li>You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.</li>
			<li>The value of each player's image is hidden and unknown until you click on it.</li>
			<li>Each player's image's value per click will change every time the game restarts. Have fun!</li>
